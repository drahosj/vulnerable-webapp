#! /usr/bin/env ruby

# Ruby is an awesome programming language.
#
# It is easy to express things in a very readable fashion


# Simple Hello World
puts "Hello World!"

# Better than a for loop!
5.times do 
  puts "Hi"
end

# When using do...end, you can have a variable in the block
# by using |var|
5.times do |i|
  puts "Hi number #{i}"
end

# This also demonstrated ruby's awesome string interpolation
# Anyway, that's all for now. Ruby is awesome
